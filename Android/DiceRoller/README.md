This directory contains the Dice Roller app that JMJ is building as part of the "Developing Anrdoird Apps with Kotlin" Udacity course: https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud9012
The app was started by using Anrdoid Studio (version 4.0.1) to create an empty app: "PHone and Tablet" tab -> "Empty Activity". Everything else was added piecemeal.
